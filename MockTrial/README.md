## Blockchain-Backed Digital Signatures Mock Trial 

**The Mock Trial in intended to test the "admissibility" and "enforceability" of Blockchain based digital signatures. Time and resource permitting, variations of the fact pattern and technology may also permit testing applicability of this technology for creating valid notarizations, legal attestations and legitimate informed consent.  It is hoped and intended that a tangible result of the Mock Trial will be a one page laminated sheet (and PDF) for trial lawyers who need to litigate this type of evidence and we want to focus the other side of the page on education and considerations for judges who adjudicate these cases.**

General inquiries for the [Mock Trial referenced in the research statement](https://law.mit.edu/contributing-our-open-source-projects) include whether the following technologies individually or in any combination provide any measurable new benefits, costs or risks:

* Cryptographic digital signatures on otherwise standard web-based contracts
* Using cryptographic keys of a blockchain address for digital signatures on otherwise standard web-based contracts
* Using cryptographic keys in the physical possession of the person executing a digital signature on their own behalf


**The following contextual scenarios represent a nexus point between legal "fact patterns" and technical "use cases".**

### Contextual Scenario: Blockchain-Pegged Digital Signatures for Otherwise Standard Digital Transactions

#### Use Case 1.1 - Blockchain-Backed Digital Signatures on Contract for the Sale of Goods

**Use Case Fact Pattern:**

* Alice uses digital signatures and a blockchain address created with a commercial app 
* Alice decides to buy a used car from Bob for $8000 at a discount of $2,000 discount because Bob insists on cash payment.
* Alice and Bob agree on a standard contract in PDF format. 
* Alice uses her app to digitally sign the contract first, then Bob signs with a comparable commercia app. 
* Alice and Bob each have an exact copy of the mutually signed contract.
* Alice provides $8,000 in cash to Bob in exchange for Bob's car title and keys.
* Alice discovers the vehicle is made of realistic looking clay when she attempts to unlock the door.
* Alice sues Bob in Suffolk Superior Court in the City of Boston, where Alice lives.

**Use Case Evaluation Criteria:**

* Does use of the apps provide evidence of the contract that is admissible by Alice in court?
* Does use of the apps provide evidence of the contract that is enforceable against Bob?
* Does use of the apps provide a overall better or worse basis for ensuring predictable legal results?

#### Use Case 1.2 - App Providers are US Federal Credit Unions

* Alice uses digital signatures and a blockchain address created with an app provided by her Credit Union. 
* Alice decides to buy a used car from Bob for $8000 at a discount of $2,000 discount because Bob insists on cash payment.
* Alice and Bob agree on a standard contract in PDF format. 
* Alice uses her app to digitally sign the contract first, then Bob signs with a comparable app from his Credit Union. 
* Alice and Bob each have an exact copy of the mutually signed contract.
* Alice provides $8,000 in cash to Bob in exchange for Bob's car title and keys.
* Alice discovers the vehicle is made of realistic looking [clay](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clay) when she attempts to unlock the door.
* Alice sues Bob in Suffolk Superior Court in the City of Boston, where Alice lives.

**Use Case Evaluation Criteria:**

* Does use of Federal Credit Unions as app providers result in any measurable new benefits, costs or risks?

### Contextual Scenario: Blockchain-Pegged Digital Signatures for Identity Attributes and Verified Claims  

#### Use Case 1.1 - Blockchain-Backed Digital Signatures on Age and Ship-To Address of E-Commerce Consumer

[Note: explore impact on identity theft and other common fraud[

#### Use Case 1.2 - App Providers are US Federal Credit Unions

[Note: Explore the impact of linking depository account holder (KYC/AML/etc) and Public Key on Blockchain]
