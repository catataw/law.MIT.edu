Keychain Access is a longstanding part of the Apple operating systems that provides fine-grained choices and configuration management for individuals to control their own identity and personal data using public key crytography. 

Specifically, Keychain Access provides ordinary people the power to use public key cryptography for individual control of their own key pairs, digital signatures, identity attributes, public key certificates and authorization decisions about whether, when and how to connect with or exchange data with another person or other entity.  The provided functionality enables on-the-fly approval decisions and also configuration of ongoing rules governing authorization and key management default choices or behaviors.  Such methods and mechisms of control are absolutely essential to exercise ownership of identity and data. 

Any modern approach to leverage public key cryptography for individuals should seemlessly interoperate with and leverage both blockchain/distributed ledger technology and also integrate deeply with and extend other Mobile/Web-Based tools where the individual's identity and data also exit.  The current version (9.0+) of Apple Keychain Access, combined with the right combination of currectly available apps and services may provide sufficient key management ownership and lifecycle management control for individuals to exercise usable ownership of their personal identity and data.  The capability, readiness, fit and value of Keychain Access in combination with other solutions to enable realistic and scalable individual control of personal identity and data can be meaningfully evaluated with appropriate data against objective business, legal and technical criteria. It may be possible to meaningfully assess this approach relatively quickly by prototyping the most relevant events and functionality of the postulated solution and testing core assertions and assumptions of the hypothesis with realistic observation-based, outcome-based, performace-based and simulation-based evaluation scoring.  To achieve reasonable certainty for the business and legal dimensions of the hypotehsis, the prototype and test regime can be developed to support a few different configurations reflecting key aspects of a few carefully scoped ecommerce, home banking, social network (and perhaps other) benchmark scenarios.  Success metrics can be established to expect each scenario will involve a subset of different specific assumptions, functionality, workflows, etc such that assessment process for each scenario may include a subset of somewhat different functional, observational,  perfomance based, simulation based, etc testing and assessment criteria.  

Iteratively developed success metrics, rapid prototyping and better targeted testing and evaluation can may be capable of identifying the most important business, legal and technical factors necessary to evaluate whether - or the extent to which - this postulated solution can be predicted to work.  At the highest level of goal-statement, I'd suggest success would be achieved uf a solution could be demonstrated to provide sufficient value, readiness and fit to be adopted in multiple key market and legal contexts.  Key contexts are those capable of catalyzing a reliably maintainable, suitably adaptable and rapidly ascalable solution for transition to a New Deal on Data.

## Keychain Access Assessment

* Functionality  
* Interoperability
* Usability


## Notes

* Serious issue with old-school adoption of PKI
* Options for self-issued and self-signed certificates may present opportunities to attept modular replacement, parralell support or augmenting use of web-oriented and blockchain enabled approaches
* Interop with something like MetaMask or the DCU pilot code by Christian's team would alow much flexibility
* ICloud Sync could likewise enable good extensibility into varied network environments and computational systems while affording a significant fixed physical asset (the hardware laptop) as essential point of ownership admin for exercise of control and management.   

## Parking Lot of Key Followup Items

**trust policy**

A trust policy determines whether a certificate is valid for the designated use. A certificate may be valid for some uses but not for others.

macOS uses a number of trust policies to determine whether a certificate is trusted. Each certificate can have a different policy. In Keychain Access you can view the details of the certificate trust policy in the Trust section of the certificate.
