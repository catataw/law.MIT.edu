## Share Questions and Ideas

Just sharing questions that occur to you while poking around this part of the repository can be a very constructive contribution.  If you have the question, there is a reasonable chance others do too and good questions are valuable whether or not there is a direct answer available.  

Likewise, you are welcome to share your own observations about emerging themes/trends/etc or insights about important unsolved challenges and other ideas.  

**How Do I Pose Questions and Ideas?**

The best way to share your questions, ideas and other comments is by creating an ["issue"](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues).  Adding the most relevant [label(s)](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests) to your issue can make it much easier to discover, understand and address.
