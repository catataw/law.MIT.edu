A trust policy determines whether a certificate is valid for the designated use. A certificate may be valid for some uses but not for others.

macOS uses a number of trust policies to determine whether a certificate is trusted. Each certificate can have a different policy. In Keychain Access you can view the details of the certificate trust policy in the Trust section of the certificate.
