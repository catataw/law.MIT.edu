# Individual Identity and Personal Data and a New Asset Class

Identity as an Asset Class
* similar to a natural resource 
* brand eg Supreme, Kith
** an endorsement 
** physicallocation and "check ins"
** purchase behavior 
** Social Network

If you aren't paying, you are the product The more time I spend thinking about it the more I feel like services like the Internet in the large but also to an extent social networking should probably be a utility There's a pretty fundamental perverse incentive for a company that acts as a discovery agent for content to also transact on the content that it displays to you I think I do need something that's really interesting to think about in the context of the Internet but ultimately I think it's something of a lost cause without a stronger means of ownership for an individual over their online presence Sorry I am dictating into my phone since I'm walking rem and it's being translated poorly I think identity is*
