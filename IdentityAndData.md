> "Let's face it - our digital identity and personal data are important economic and practical resources of ever increasing value. Personal identity involves more than money can buy, but it's also part of an emerging digital asset class.  Thriving industries exist to collect, track and trade this information while business and legal models respecting the rights and expectations of all the stakeholders (including you as a consumer) have not evolved to keep pace.  The rise of "smart" phones, homes and cities accelerated by blockchain, smart contracts and mass-automation offer new modes for control, methods for valuation and mechanisms for exchange of key rights to this new asset type. We will catalyze and focus discussion around an applied identity anchor scenario exploring the legal validity, admissibility and enforceability of blockchain-based digital signatures to grant or revoke consent and authorization for electronic transactions. What are the key issues, options and opportunities for innovative FinTech products, services and markets arising from this new digital asset class?  Join the discussion and let's find out - together."

# Identity as an Asset

* similar to a natural resource 
* brand eg Supreme, Kith
** an endorsement 
** physicallocation and "check ins"
** purchase behavior 
** Social Network

If you aren't paying, you are the product The more time I spend thinking about it the more I feel like services like the Internet in the large but also to an extent social networking should probably be a utility There's a pretty fundamental perverse incentive for a company that acts as a discovery agent for content to also transact on the content that it displays to you I think I do need something that's really interesting to think about in the context of the Internet but ultimately I think it's something of a lost cause without a stronger means of ownership for an individual over their online presence Sorry I am dictating into my phone since I'm walking rem and it's being translated poorly I think identity is*
