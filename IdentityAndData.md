# Identity as an Asset

> Personal identity involves more than money can buy, but it's also part of an emerging digital asset class.  



**Comments: 
New York based MIT-Law Collaborator Caitlin Stilin-Rooney noted 
There are a different attributes of ones identity that individual chocies such as the brands or designers that one wear (ig. Supreme, KITH, Louie Vuitton) The economics of identity come into play when the brands we wear or the clubs that we are part of add value to a certain business. 


* brand eg Supreme, Kith
** an endorsement 
** physical location and "check ins"
** purchase behavior 
** Social Network
New York based software engineer Brian McFeeley noted: "If you aren't paying, you are the product. The more time I spend thinking about it the more I feel like services like the Internet in the large but also to an extent social networking should probably be a utility There's a pretty fundamental perverse incentive for a company that acts as a discovery agent for content to also transact on the content that it displays to you I think I do need something that's really interesting to think about in the context of the Internet but ultimately I think it's something of a lost cause without a stronger means of ownership for an individual over their online presence Sorry I am dictating into my phone since I'm walking rem and it's being translated poorly I think identity is."

# Personal Data as an Asset

> Thriving industries exist to collect, track and trade personal data while business and legal models respecting the rights and expectations of all the stakeholders (including you as a consumer) have not evolved to keep pace.

# Current Models

> The rise of "smart" phones, homes and cities accelerated by blockchain, smart contracts and mass-automation offer new modes for control, methods for valuation and mechanisms for exchange of key rights to this new asset type.

# Anchor Scenario 

> To catalyze and focus discussion, consider the following applied identity anchor scenario exploring the legal validity, admissibility and enforceability of blockchain-based digital signatures to grant or revoke consent and authorization for electronic transactions.

# Discussion Questions 

> What are the key issues, options and opportunities for innovative FinTech products, services and markets arising from this new digital asset class?  Join the discussion and let's find out - together."
