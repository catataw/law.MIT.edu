> Let's face it - our digital identity and personal data are important economic and practical resources of ever increasing value. 

# Identity as an Asset

> Personal identity involves more than money can buy, but it's also part of an emerging digital asset class.  

* similar to a natural resource 
* brand eg Supreme, Kith
** an endorsement 
** physicallocation and "check ins"
** purchase behavior 
** Social Network

New York based software engineer Brian McFeeley noted: "If you aren't paying, you are the product The more time I spend thinking about it the more I feel like services like the Internet in the large but also to an extent social networking should probably be a utility There's a pretty fundamental perverse incentive for a company that acts as a discovery agent for content to also transact on the content that it displays to you I think I do need something that's really interesting to think about in the context of the Internet but ultimately I think it's something of a lost cause without a stronger means of ownership for an individual over their online presence Sorry I am dictating into my phone since I'm walking rem and it's being translated poorly I think identity is."

# Personal Data as an Asset

> Thriving industries exist to collect, track and trade personal data while business and legal models respecting the rights and expectations of all the stakeholders (including you as a consumer) have not evolved to keep pace.

# Economic and Legal Models

> The rise of "smart" phones, homes and cities accelerated by blockchain, smart contracts and mass-automation offer new modes for control, methods for valuation and mechanisms for exchange of key rights to this new asset type.

# Anchor Scenario 

> To catalyze and focus discussion, consider the following applied identity anchor scenario exploring the legal validity, admissibility and enforceability of blockchain-based digital signatures to grant or revoke consent and authorization for electronic transactions.

# Discussion Questions 

> What are the key issues, options and opportunities for innovative FinTech products, services and markets arising from this new digital asset class?  Join the discussion and let's find out - together."
