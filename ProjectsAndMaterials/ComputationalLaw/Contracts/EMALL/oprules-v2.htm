is an Extranet procurement Web site, hosted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 
and available to participating states (known as State Partners in this 
document). The Emall web site provides links to qualified Supplier "storefronts" 
or catalogs, where state procurement staff (known as authorized State Users) can 
browse, shop and create requisitions. Public Key Certificate technology coupled 
with user name and password ensure that only authorized State Users can submit 
approved OBI Orders to the approved suppliers (known as authorized Supplier 
Partners).&nbsp; In addition, casual, non-priviliged Internet users can access 
certain public portions of the site, but can not engage in binding transactions 
unless they are authorized participants in this pilot and agree to accept these 
Operating Rules.</FONT>

<DIR><I><FONT size=-1>The OBI standard is an open, flexible design for 
business-to-business Internet commerce solutions. It is intended for the 
high-volume, low-dollar transactions that account for 80% of most organizations' 
purchasing activities. Version 1.0 of the standard document contains an 
architecture, as well as technical specifications and guidelines. OBI is not a 
product or a service; it is a freely available standard which any organization 
can obtain and use.</FONT></I></DIR></DIR><FONT size=-1>Information about the 
OBI standard is available at the web site <U><A

User name and Password must be supplied by every User of the EMall Server 
accessing a non-public portion of the system. No User may share or otherwise 
reveal their Password or other authorized Personal Identification Number 
(PIN).&nbsp; Any suspicion that a Password has been compromised must be 
immediately communicated to the State Coordinator for that User. A Password may 
be re-set in the event that an authorized User forgets the Password. A User 
should contact their State Coordinator, who can authorize a password reset from 
the Operations Administrator.&nbsp; Upon proper notification by an authorized 
State Coordinator under these Operating Rules and relevant implementing 
agreements, a User's access to the EMall will be terminated and the respective 
User name and Password combination for a terminated User will no longer be 
valid.</FONT>

Layer (SSL) protocol. The SSL protocol will be used to authenticate and secure 
certain communications between Supplier servers and the EMall server as well as 
to encrypt certain session between the browser of a User and the EMall server 
and authenticate the identity of authorized EMall Users. A web session invoking 
version 3 of the SSL protocol requires use of a duly issued Public Key 
Certificate within the browser of an EMall User.&nbsp; SSL 3 is also required to 
authenticate and secure the transmission of a valid OBI Order from the EMall 
server to the server of a Supplier.</FONT>

will require greater specificity regarding permitted and prohibited methods of 
communication and corresponding authentication depending on the purposes of the 
communications. It is intended that experience gained through this pilot process 
will demonstrate appropriate guidelines. For purposes of the pilot, however, it 
is expected that most non-critical communications will occur between pilot

Introduction</FONT></B></DIR></DIR><FONT size=-1>For purposes of the Multi-State 
EMall pilot, a Public Key Certificate (Certificate) is a computer-based record 
which:</FONT> 
<UL><FONT size=-1>(a) identifies the entity or brand associated with issuance 
  of it;</FONT> <BR><FONT size=-1>(b) names or identifies the person or device 
  associated with the corresponding private key;</FONT> <BR><FONT size=-1>(c) 
  contains the public key corresponding to that private key of that person or 
  device; and</FONT> <BR><FONT size=-1>(d) is digitally signed by the 
  Certificate Manufacturer that creates the Certificate.</FONT></UL><FONT 
size=-1>In transacting business over the Internet, it is critical that both the 
seller and buyer be assured that the transactions exchanged are secure. Public 
key encryption coupled with Public Key Certificates can provide part of this 
security by ensuring the confidentiality and/or authentication of electronic 
business exchanges. When Public Key Certificates are attached to transactions, 
parties on each side of a purchase have some evidence of who the message came 
from and that it was not tampered with. The EMall pilot uses Certificates to 
bolster the authentication provided by the Password and User name in the Emall 
system. A Certificate is not, by itself, sufficient to perform any transactions 
within the EMall system.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>Public Key Certificates are used to authenticate Web servers 
and their clients via protocols such as SSL 3.0. A Public Key Certificate is 
analogous to an identification card issued by an employer or membership 
organization. Each User participating in the EMall pilot must have at least one 
Public Key Certificate. Certificates will be issued at no cost by a designated 
and contracted party known as a Certificate Manufacturer (CM). The CM will issue 
a Certificate to Users who have been identified by their respective State 
Coordinators and accepted by the EMall Administrator.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>The browser specifications, as noted in the Section E Technical 
Requirements, accommodates the use of Public Key Certificates.&nbsp; A technical 
resource for each State Partner will be needed to assist each User with 
the&nbsp; installation of that User's Certificate. This technical resource 
and/or the state coordinator must have an adequate understanding of the 
technical and operational requirements and responsibilities associated with 
managing, issuing and maintaining Public Key Certificates.&nbsp; The technician 
shall not have knowledge of any User's password.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>This Certificate Policy section of these Operating Rules 
governs creation, delivery and other aspects of the Certificate Manufacturing 
process as well as the proper use of Public Key Certificates. This section 
follows the format of the Internet Engineering Task Force PKIX Part 4 Framework 
(available at <A 
href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pkix-ipki-part4-03.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-pkix-ipki-part4-03.txt</A>) 
and is in general accord with the guidance provided by Version 1.0 of the draft 
"Guidelines for Constructing Policies Governing the Use of Identity-Based Public 
Key Certificates" by the Certificate Authority Ratings and Trust (CARAT) Task 
Force of the Internet Council of the National Automated Clearinghouse 
Association (NACHA) available at <A 
href="http://internetcouncil.nacha.org/CARAT/">http://internetcouncil.nacha.org/CARAT/</A>) 
.&nbsp; Please note that many of the basic business and legal terms surrounding 
each party's role within the EMall are properly addressed in other sections of 
these Operating Rules and will either supplement or replace information reserved 
under IETF PKIX-4 headings (such as "liability" and "financial responsibility"

<DIR>
<DIR><A name="D.1. General Concepts"></A><B><FONT face=Arial>D.1. General 
Concepts</FONT></B></DIR></DIR><B>Party: </B><FONT size=-1>A legal entity. A 
natural person can be a party. Certain organizations, such as corporations, 
trusts and governments may also be recognized as a legal person and therefore 
can be a party. Each party will be identified by name in relevant documents and 
agreements.&nbsp; Actions of an automated program, including an electronic 
agent, are deemed to be the actions of a party that used the program for that 
purpose, under these Operating Rules.</FONT> 
<P><B>Functions: </B><FONT size=-1>The particular duties and obligations entered 
into within a business and technical system. A Party will perform several 
functions. These sets of functions are put together based on technical, legal 
and business needs of the enterprise.</FONT> 
<P><B>Role: </B><FONT size=-1>Each <I>role</I> is named according to the nature 
of the functions in each set. By naming roles, and associating functions with 
roles, it is not suggested that in every business model sets of functions will 
be divided in the same manner as here. Further, it is not suggested that there 
will be one-to-one correlation between roles and parties. Indeed, it is 
envisioned that a <I>party</I> may perform one or more roles. The purpose for 
naming roles in this document is primarily to provide a vocabulary for creating 
modular parts that can be perform by a given party entering the EMall system and 
to organize the obligations and related documents associated with a given 
party.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>For example, rather than call the administration role by the 
name Commonwealth of Massachusetts, it is convenient to name it based on the 
relevant suite of functions so that any party could perform the role more easily 
within the system of documents and business arrangements herein. Similarly, 
while particular parties perform the role of service providers, there may be 
additional and/or different parties playing those roles in the future, hence we 
use terms like "solution provider" and "Certificate Manufacturer." The usage of 
roles under these Operating Rules is intended to reflect and support the 
potential evolution of this project from a relatively closed and small pilot to 
a scalable production system in which many more parties may perform the roles 
noted herein.</FONT> 
<P><B>Documents and Agreements: </B><FONT size=-1>In many cases, a party will 
have to sign a document or submit a particular form as part of the functions 
associated with a given role. These documents might be contracts, memoranda of 
understanding, applications, reports and so on. These documents hold a 
particular legal importance as the glue that hold together parties, roles and 
functions in a predictable and enforceable system.</FONT> 
<P><B>Pilot Participants: </B><FONT size=-1>Every party that agrees to be bound 
by the Operating Rules is considered to be a "Pilot Participant."&nbsp; This 
general designation defines the closed community of people who are part of the 
EMall pilot.&nbsp; All of the parties whose roles are described below (not 
limited to Users alone) are also considered Pilot Participants because they all 
agree to be bound by these Operating Rules and to operate within the pilot in 
some authorized manner.</FONT>
