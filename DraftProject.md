1. What are the right legal models for this type of identity service focused on refugees?  how would the legal identity relate, if at all, to a government credential accepted for KYC and immigration etc? 

In the context of a Blockchain Border Bank:
1. We must know the government's perspective on the population that we are working with 
2. In the case of the BBB "refugees" vs illegal immigrants or citizens with questioned status by host country

2. What is the business model?  A non-profit is in a position to fund and create or maintain the expensive and complex service types. How can this type of technology service and business operation be set up in a workable yet appropriate manner to provide this type of basic human identity  service in a way that is consistent with the public interest needs of regular people - and most challenging of all - for the resource starved and vulnerable refugee community? Especially with slow pace and heavy hype and absolute need for profit in a big way are not necessarily consistent with the priorities and needs expected from such a service

**Problems with creating a viable business model**  
Host country already views this population as illegal and therefore not willing to accept it as a moral or ethical project 

**Potential benefits**

1. Portability or accessibility of personal data (which should also be protected data) 
2. Availability of this info to service providers and organizations to save them money 

**Action Needed**
Agreement between government, and social organizations to work together to recognize value of a blockchain ecosystem
Mechanism for storgae to be built such as a (PdS) whereby the sharing of personal data would save them money and allow them to work more efficiently 
Collective investment for a particular service
Clearly mapped path for adoption - one or more service provider could implement the solution as a reciptiens of a grant or funding by internaitonal, public or social org
